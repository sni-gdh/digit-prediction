# digit-recognition
Digit recognition using minst-all data set,
containing 60K training and 10k testing examples of hand written digit,Each example in the dataset is represented by784 features corresponding to
(28Ã—28) pixel values([0,255]).
The classes are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 corresponding to each digit.

this project implement the nueral network learning algorithm(using back propogation) to recognise the digits given the pixel values.
the accuracy over training data come up to 92 percent.

and the accuracy over the testing data also come up to be 90 percent.

final output look like this:
